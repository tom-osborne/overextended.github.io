# Ox Lib

A standalone library for providing easily reusable code as importable modules and exports.

<ResourceLinks repo="https://github.com/overextended/ox_lib" />

## Installation

<Callout type="info">

We **strongly** recommend referring to [Guides](../guides) for setting up Git, Node.js, and pnpm.

</Callout>

<Steps>

### Download a [release](https://github.com/overextended/ox_lib/releases) or build the source code.

```bash copy filename="terminal"
git clone https://github.com/overextended/ox_lib.git
cd ox_lib/web
pnpm i
pnpm build
```

### Config

Resource configuration is handled using [convars](https://docs.fivem.net/docs/scripting-reference/convars/).

```bash copy filename="server.cfg"
# https://v6.mantine.dev/theming/colors/#default-colors
setr ox:primaryColor blue
setr ox:primaryShade 8
setr ox:userLocales 1 # Allow users to select their locales using /ox_lib
```

You'll also need to grant ace permissions to the resource.

```bash copy filename="server.cfg"
add_ace resource.ox_lib command.add_ace allow
add_ace resource.ox_lib command.remove_ace allow
add_ace resource.ox_lib command.add_principal allow
add_ace resource.ox_lib command.remove_principal allow
```

</Steps>

## Usage

<Tabs items={["Lua", "JS"]}>
<Tab>

To enable the library inside of your resource just add `@ox_lib/init.lua` as a shared_script in your `fxmanifest.lua` file.

```lua copy filename="fxmanifest.lua"
shared_scripts {
    '@ox_lib/init.lua',
}
```

Or if the library is the only shared script you use you can do:

```lua copy filename="fxmanifest.lua"
shared_script '@ox_lib/init.lua'
```

You can specify modules to import from inside your `fxmanifest.lua`, or load them dynamically.

```lua copy
ox_libs {
    'locale',
    'math',
    'table',
}
```

When ox_lib has been imported into your script, it will make several new globals available:
- `lib` for dynamically importing ox_lib modules into your script.
- `require` for importing modules from your own script.
- `cache` see [here](./ox_lib/Modules/Cache/Shared).

</Tab>
<Tab>

<Callout>
Npm package for the lib does **not** support all the functions that are available for Lua.

All supported functions are located inside the `resource` folder in the lib.

</Callout>

You can get the npm package [here](https://npmjs.com/package/@overextended/ox_lib).

**Usage:**  
You can either import the whole library object which contains all the functions for that scope (client/server/shared) or you can deconstruct it and import the functions you find needed at the time.

```ts copy
import lib from '@overextended/ox_lib/server';
```

```ts copy
import { versionCheck } from '@overextended/ox_lib/server';
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

You can now use the library functions inside of your resource, check the rest of the documentation to see how to utilise them.

## Using icons for interface functions

The icon library used is Font Awesome 6.0, if for the icon you define only a string the default icon type will be `solid`.  
If you want to use a different icon type, i.e apple as a brand, you need to define icon as a table (`array`) with the first value being the icon type (`fas`, `far`, `fab`) as a string, and the second being the icon name.

<Tabs items={["Lua", "JS"]}>
<Tab>

```lua copy
icon = {'fab', 'apple'}
```

</Tab>
<Tab>

```ts copy
icon: ['fab', 'apple'];
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Building the UI

If you wish to edit any of the UI elements you will need to download the _source_ code, edit what you need and then compile it.

<Callout type="warning">

**DO NOT** de-bundle and un-minify the release CSS and JS files to edit them.

</Callout>
**Requirements:**

- [Node.js (LTS)](https://nodejs.org/)
- pnpm

**Installing Node.js:**

- Download the LTS version of Node.js.
- Go through the install and make sure you install all of the features.
- Run node --version in cmd and make sure that it gives you the version number. If it doesn't then you didn't install it correctly.

**Installing pnpm:**

- After installing NodeJS you can install pnpm by running `npm install -g pnpm`.

**Building the UI:**

- cd into the web directory.
- run `pnpm i` to install the dependencies.
- run `pnpm build` to build the source files.

<Callout type="info">
When working in the browser you can run `pnpm start`, which supports hot reloads meaning that
you will see your changes after saving your file.

If you want to work in game you can run `pnpm start:game` which writes changes to disk, so
the only thing you have to do is restart the resource for it take affect.
