<ResourceLinks repo="https://github.com/overextended/oxmysql" />

A replacement of mysql-async and ghmattimysql with expanded API and improved compatibility for MySQL 8.

## MySQL or MariaDB?

Most resources for FiveM were designed to be used with MySQL 5.7 and may hit compatibility issues when using MySQL 8, i.e.

- More reserved keywords, like 'stored' and 'group'.
- Longtext / JSON fields do not support default values.

[MariaDB](https://mariadb.com/downloads/community/) is highly recommended for compatibility, and improved performance (over all versions of MySQL).

## Should I use XAMPP?

**No.** XAMPP is a _webserver stack_ intended to be used for development, allowing easy local development and testing.  
Do not setup XAMPP just to run your database, and install [MariaDB](https://mariadb.com/downloads/community/) directly instead.

## Installation

<Steps>

### Download and install [MariaDB](https://mariadb.com/downloads/community/)

### Download the [latest release](https://github.com/overextended/oxmysql/releases/latest) of oxmysql

### Configure your server

- Open your server [configuration file](https://docs.fivem.net/docs/server-manual/setting-up-a-server-vanilla/#servercfg).
- Add `start oxmysql` to the top of your resource list.
- Configure your mysql connection string and set it before starting any resources.

```bash copy
# Use your preferred format. Make sure you only ever use set.
set mysql_connection_string "mysql://root:12345@localhost:3306/fivem"
set mysql_connection_string "user=root;password=12345;host=localhost;port=3306;database=fivem"
```

<Callout type="info">

Certain special characters are reserved or unsupported depending on your connection string.  
Avoid using these characters `; , / ? : @ & = + $ #`, and try swapping connection string format.

</Callout>

### Slow query warnings

You will receive warnings if a query took a long time to complete, configurable with a convar.  
- Query time may not be entirely accurate.
- Slow queries may not indicate a database issue (e.g. server hitches).
- Slow queries on server startup are not necessarily problematic.

```bash copy
set mysql_slow_query_warning 150
```

### Debug

Enabling the debug option will print all queries in the server console; you can also use an array to only print from a list of resources instead.

```bash copy
set mysql_debug true
set mysql_debug [
  "ox_core",
  "ox_inventory"
]
```

You can temporarily modify the resource list with commands.

```bash copy
oxmysql_debug remove ox_core
oxmysql_debug add ox_core
```

</Steps>

## Compatibility

You can delete the following resources and allow oxmysql to provide their functionality.

- mysql-async
- ghmattimysql

## Usage

Resources can import oxmysql methods by including our library, granting some type-checking and minor performance improvements over raw export calls.

### Lua

Modify `fxmanifest.lua` for your resource, and add the following above any other script files.

```lua copy filename="fxmanifest.lua"
server_script '@oxmysql/lib/MySQL.lua'
```

### JavaScript

You can use raw exports, or install [our npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@overextended/oxmysql) for intellisense and similar usage as Lua.

```bash copy
# With pnpm
pnpm add @overextended/oxmysql

# With Yarn
yarn add @overextended/oxmysql

# With npm
npm install @overextended/oxmysql
```

Import the oxmysql object into your resource.

```js copy
import { oxmysql as MySQL } from '@overextended/oxmysql';
```

## Upserting

When uncertain if a row should be inserted into the database, or an existing row should be updated, queries should check for duplicate keys.

```lua copy
MySQL.prepare('INSERT INTO ox_inventory (owner, name, data) VALUES (?, ?, ?) ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE data = VALUES(data)', { owner, dbId, inventory })
```

This is preferred over checking the existence of a row, then inserting or updating depending on the result.  
Furthermore, unlike using 'REPLACE INTO', the row is not deleted and re-inserted.
