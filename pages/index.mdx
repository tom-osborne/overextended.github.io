# Introduction

Overextended is a small group working to create open-source resources for FiveM, with a focus on quality, security, performance and stability.
You can find all of the official documentation for resources developed by the Overextended team on this website.

If you feel like our documentation is lacking, please leat us know or suggest improvements by using the links in the sidebar.

## Our team

We're a small team made up of both hobby and professional programmers. We enjoy being able to create and share [free and open-source](https://opensource.org/osd) resources, but it can often require considerable time and investment to maintain and support them.

Our team members volunteer to help keep things running smoothly; feel free to check out their work or show your appreciation by supporting them below.

## Creator codes

Creator codes allow Tebex stores to share a percentage of a purchase with us, while giving a discount to the customer. We make these deals to advertise trusted creators who meet our criteria.

- Resources are highly configurable or, preferably, source-available.
- We trust that customers will be given assistance.
- The creator is a known member of our community.

More information about these creators is available in our [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/813030955598086174/1028912864389496903).
