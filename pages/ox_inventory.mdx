# Ox Inventory

<ResourceLinks repo="https://github.com/overextended/ox_inventory" />

A slot-based inventory with item metadata for "item uniqueness".

<Callout type="warning">

If you are replacing a built-in framework inventory there will be compatibility errors.  
If you are unwilling or incapable of resolving incompatibilities, do not install this resource.

</Callout>

## Installation

<Callout type="info">

We **strongly** recommend referring to [Guides](../guides) for setting up Git, Node.js, and pnpm.

</Callout>

<Steps>
### Install all resource dependencies
- [oxmysql](../oxmysql)
- [ox_lib](../ox_lib/)

### Download a [release](https://github.com/overextended/ox_inventory/releases) or build the source code.

```bash copy filename="terminal"
git clone https://github.com/overextended/ox_inventory.git
cd ox_inventory/web
pnpm i
pnpm build
```

### Install optional dependencies

These resources aren't required but provide additional functionality.

- [ox_target](../ox_target/)

### Resource start order

It's important for your resources to start in a logical order to prevent errors from missing dependencies.

```bash copy filename="server.cfg"
start oxmysql   # this should be one of the first resources
start ox_lib
start framework # the name of your framework (i.e. ox_core, es_extended, qbx_core)
start ox_target
start ox_inventory
```

### Config

Resource configuration is handled using [convars](https://docs.fivem.net/docs/scripting-reference/convars/).

```bash copy

## Framework incompatibilities

- Any frameworks with their own built-in inventory, item, or weapon systems are expected to have compatibility issues.
- Money as an item may conflict with banking/account systems.
  - You can sync these values with [server.syncInventory](https://github.com/overextended/ox_inventory/blob/aff8ef9e9ee3f93f177ce03b3f37895ff5781800/modules/bridge/nd/server.lua#L64-L77).

Refer to issue [#1297](https://github.com/overextended/ox_inventory/issues/1297) for known compatibility issues.

## Using an unsupported framework

If your framework does not have official support you'll have to implement it yourself.  
If you're replacing an existing/built-in inventory system this may be complicated, but is a fairly simple task otherwise.

This setup is highly opinionated and rigid, so it's up to your own ability as a developer to make it work.

<Steps>
### Setup a bridge submodule

You'll want to set the target framework first - this could be the name, an acronym, or just "custom".

```bash
setr inventory:framework "custom"
```

Copy the `ox` directory from the [bridge](https://github.com/overextended/ox_inventory/tree/main/modules/bridge) directory and give it the name you used above.

The bare minimum functions and event handlers are added here, but you'll need to change them to match your framework; we can't provide any help here. You can refer to the other framework bridges if you need inspiration.

### Setup database references

Take a look at the [mysql](https://github.com/overextended/ox_inventory/blob/main/modules/mysql/server.lua) module. You'll need to reference your player/vehicle tables and id columns.

```lua
elseif shared.framework == 'custom' then
    playerTable = 'characters' -- table storing player / character data
    playerColumn = 'charid'    -- primary key for identifying the character (i.e. identifier, citizenid, id)
    vehicleTable = 'vehicles'  -- table storing owned vehicle data
    vehicleColumn = 'id'       -- primary key for identifying the vehicle (i.e. plate, vin, id)
end
```

</Steps>
